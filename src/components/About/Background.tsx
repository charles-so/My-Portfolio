I'm on a graduation visa with full working rights for five years (until 2029) and intend to settle here afterward. I completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at The University of Western Australia in December 2023, with a minor in Data Science and additional elective courses in Finance. The aim was to grasp the fundamentals of statistics and budgeting, and to enhance collaboration with individuals from diverse backgrounds.";

In my second year, I volunteered as a UniMentor, aiding the integration of first-year students into university life by sharing my experiences and connections with these clubs. In addition to theoretical learning, I pursued internships to gain hands-on experience with real clients. In my first internship, I contributed to designing and developing the frontend interface of an autonomous bus. In the second internship, I collaborated with a team to develop a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system using Microsoft PowerApps with Azure Database, deploying it on SharePoint.";
